            "Quit your crying" she says. "We're not going very far."
            But you all know that's a lie.
            It's at least a ten hour drive to the grandparents.
            Your dad is loading suitcases into the luggage carrier,
            and the middle child comes outside with the tarrier.
            And yeah, I don't really know

            Then I imagine you're waving goodbye
            to three kids, a dog and your parents, as the sun begins to rise.
            You'll hold down the fort, and you'll work for the guy down the road,
            I forgot his name.
            We haven't met up in ages, been a year of uncertainty.
            You're not returning my phonecalls, and that really worries me.
            I'm in the street begging for bus fare, but soon I will be there
            and I'll hold you tightly.
